#### Holiday and Vocation

Do you like Holiday？
    Yes, I love Holiday because It give me a chance to take a break from work.
    And I can spend time to relax and unwind with my family.

假期会做什么? / 假期更喜欢旅行还是待在家里？
    Personaly, I prefer to travel in holiday. 
    every time I go out for a hike or camp, I feel unwinded and comfortable when a breeze blows on me.
    although there's always to much traffic during the holiday, it's annoying.

Favorite Holiday?
    It's hard to choose, but my favorite holiday would have to be the Mid-Autumn Festival, on August 15th of the Chinese lunar calendar.
    On that day, my whole family gets together at my parents family.
    we prepare some home-cooked dishes and moon cakes, when the moon is rised, we eat food, watch the moon and chat with each other util the midnight.

最近一次 on vocation?
    my last vocation is go out for a hike in June. tegether with my friends and we tried some local foods such as fried grasshopper. It's very intresting but tasted strange. I will never try it again.

你更喜欢在什么时候去休假
    Personally, I prefer to go on vacation in March or April, 
    because the weather is milder, neither too cold nor too warm. So I can go out for hiking and campiing.

Introduce Beijing:
    Beijing is very famous city with many attractions, such as: Great Wall, Forbidden City, Bird's Nest Stadium and so on. 
    Every year, there's many people come to Beijing for sightseeing.
