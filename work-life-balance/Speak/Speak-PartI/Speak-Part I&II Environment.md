because the government has been paying attention to environment since 2008 Beijing Olympics.
On the one hand, the government has put a lot of trash bins beside the road and inside the community.

## Part II
### Describe something you do regularly that helps protect the environment?
emmm, I usually carry a reusable bags with me almost everyday,
So that I can use my own bag to hold goods instead of plastic bags provided by retail stores or supermarkets.
The reason why I do this is because I saw a news that a tutle died from hunger because it ate too much plastic bags, the bags filled it's stomach so that the tutle can not eat food any more.
The news shocked me and let me know the harm of palstic bags. Since then, I have chosen to use plastic bags as little as possible. 
I think when everyone starts to carry a bag with him, we can reduce the harm of wasted plastic products to other animals and plants.
