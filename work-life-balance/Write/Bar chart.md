## 柱状图

### 带时间的柱状图
    - 将柱状图连线，变成折线图，然后按照折线图的思路来写

### 不带时间(或者时间占比少)的柱状图； Only compare different items
    - 在同一组内进行比较: itemA最多，itemB最少
    - 对于同一个item，进行组间比较，：对于itemA，groupB要比groupA多
    - 也可以比较不同group中，最多的分别是啥，最少的分别是啥

- **paraphrase the question**
    - 改写 - 1句话
    - 举例：
      - **brand** 品牌
      - 原：The chart below shows gloabl sales of the top five mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013.
      - 改写：The bar chart compares the number of mobile phones sold worldwide by the five most popular manufacturers in the years 2009, 2011, and 2013.
       
- **overview**

      - Samsung and Apple saw the biggest rises in sales over the 5-year period.
      
- **details**
  - 比较最主要的组: 数量最多的，或者变化最大的组
  - 如果是按时间分组，可以比较起始数量 + 趋势；如果不是时间，则逐一比较两组中的item
  - 举例：
      - In 2009, Nokia sold close to 450 million mobile phones, which was **almost double** the number of handsets sold by **the second most sucessful** manufacturer, Samsung.

      - By 2013, Samsang **had become the market leader** with sales reaching 450 million units.
     
- **details**
  - 比较其他的组
  - 先列举下其他的组，按照初始数量排序
  - 按时间分组，比较起始数量 + 趋势
  - 举例：
      - The other three top selling mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013 were LG, ZTE and Apple.
      - In 2009, these companies sold around 125 million, 50 million and 25 million mobile handsets respectively, but Apple overtook the other two vendors in 2011.
