## Consession and Ending

### Consession

|      |                                                                                   |

| 先抑 | Nevertheless, a voice arises that (opposite response and point in grand opening). |
| 驳斥 | Ironically, (facts against opposite detail)                                       |
| 结论 | Therefore, (Point3)                                                               |

- Sample
Nevertheless, a voice arises that text in email cannot convey the subtlety and diversity in communication - it creates confusion and misleading infomation, damaging our social relationship.

(Email只是一个工具)
Ironically, a hammer can hurt a person badly while millions are using it everyday. Email is simply a tool and not the only vehicle of information, we can use it mostly directly or to complement various other ways of communication. For instance, we can response a simple "YES" to an address confirmation, or inform our coworkers of the progress of the bussiness trip while keep the very details for a later face-to-face meeting.

Therefore, as long as we use our tools (email in this case) properly, we will be able to siginificantly enhance both our personal and professional relationships.

### Ending

|     |                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     | In a nutshell, I maintain that (Response Paraphrase)                                                                                                                         |
|     | Admittedly, as my favorate quota from James Madison goes, as long as the reason of man continues fallible, different opinions will be formed, and some people may oppose me. |
|     | However, I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.                                                                                                   |
